  abstract = {A class of antennas that utilizes arrays of elementary antennas as reflecting surfaces has been investigated. An antenna of this type is here called a Reflectarray. It has been found that the Reflectarray combines much of the simplicity of the reflector-type antenna with the performance versatility of the array type. The reflecting surfaces employed in these antennas are characterized by a surface impedance that can be synthesized to produce a variety of radiation patterns. The equations of the surface impedance as a function of the desired reflected phase front is derived for the lossless case and methods of realizing this surface impedance are presented. Experimental results of a waveguide array type Reflectarray are given including pencil beam, broad beam and scanning modes. Data on the effects of specific phase errors are presented.},

For the first time, a comprehensive, experimentally verified design procedure for the microstrip reflectarray is presented. In this design procedure, the microstrip reflectarray has been shown to be an effective linear array capable of beam switching and dual polarization. The design procedure also allows the array to be fed from a feed-horn offset at any given angle to the plane of the array. The design procedure is well suited for CAD programs.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Radar cross section (RCS) is a comparison of two radar signal strengths. One is the strength of the radar beam sweeping over a target, the other is the strength of the reflected echo sensed by the receiver. This book shows how the RCS gauge can be predicted for theoretical objects and how it can be measured for real targets. Predicting RCS is not easy, even for simple objects like spheres or cylinders, but this book explains the two exact forms of theory so well that even a novice will understand enough to make close predictions. Weapons systems developers are keenly interested in reducing the RCS of their platforms. The two most practical ways to reduce RCS are shaping and absorption. This book explains both in great detail, especially in the design, evaluation, and selection of radar absorbers. There is also great detail on the design and employment of indoor and outdoor test ranges for scale models or for full-scale targets (such as aircraft). In essence, this book covers everything you need to know about RCS, from what it is, how to predict and measure, and how to test targets (indoors and out), and how to beat it.}

  abstract = {In a great number of microwave applications a highly directive antenna with a main beam scanned to a certain angle is required. To achieve this a certain aperture illumination with progressive phasing is used. The two primary ways to do this are reflectors and arrays. The reflector antenna uses its geometry to create the desired phase across the aperture, while the array employs distinct elements fed with progressive phasing. Reflector antennas are advantageous in the fact that they typically exhibit large bandwidth and low loss. The main disadvantage of the reflector is the geometrical constraint it imposes on the design. The most popular reflector, the parabolic reflector, also exhibits inherently high cross polarization levels. Microstrip patch arrays are lightweight, low-profile antennas that are capable of low cross polarization levels but typically have small bandwidth and fairly large loss at microwave frequencies. The more attractive features of reflectors and arrays are combined in the reflectarray. The steps taken in the design of a microstrip reflectarray using patches of variable size are outlined. Measured and theoretical results are shown for the finished design, and several important performance criteria are compared with the microstrip reflectarray.},
